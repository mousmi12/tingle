About Me

Welcome to Tingle! Iâ€™m Mousmi Muthalib, a software developer by day and a passionate crafter by night. 
Tingle is my creative outlet where I blend the art of handmade yarn and resin creations with my love for detail and design. 
Each piece is crafted with care, love, and a touch of magic, aiming to bring a little joy and sparkle to your life. 
Thank you for visiting and supporting my small business. 
Your support means the world to me and keeps my dream alive!
